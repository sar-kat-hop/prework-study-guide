            <li>The general flow of using GitHub:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Create repo in GitHub</li>
                <li>Clone to local machine (git clone [repo name])</li>
                <li>Create new working branch with descriptive name pertaining to changes being made (git checkout -b [new branch name])</li>
                <li>Make desired changes</li>
                <li>Stage desired changes (git add -A to stage all)</li>
                <li>Commit desired changes with a comment, ideally in imperative present tense, describing changes being committed (git commit -m "[comment here])</li>
                <li>Ensure active branch is up to date before making PR or pushing changes with git pull origin main</li>
                <li>Push changes with git push origin [active branch name]</li>
                <li>Make pull request in GitHub comparing main as base to new ("comparison") branch with commits to merge</li>
                <li>Merge comparison branch into main branch</li>
                <li>Close corresponding issue in GitHub if resolved by changes</li>
                <li>Update local copy of main branch (git checkout main)</li>
                <li>Pull remote main branch into local main branch (git pull origin main)</li>
                <li>Make new branch for additional changes, repeat process as necessary</li>

          <li>git pull [branch name] (e.g., git pull origin main): pulls specified branch to update local repo</li>
          <li>git status: checks status of changes made, lists staged and ustaged changes</li>
          <li>git log: lists history of commits made in descending chronological order</li>
          <li>git branch: lists branches and indicates active branch with * followed by name of branch</li>
          <li>git checkout [branch name]: switches to specified branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b [branch name]: creates new branch and makes it active</li>
          <li>git --amend: amend most recent commit's comment/message (useful for correcting typos or other issues with commit messages)</li>
          <li>git push [remote branch to update] [active branch to update with]: pushes active branch's changes to specified remote branch (usually origin)

          <li>git merge [working branch name] [target branch name]: merges target branch into working branch (e.g., git merge feature main would merge main branch into feature branch, creating a new merge commit in the feature branch tying the histories of both together</li>
            <ul><li>git merge can also be used to incorporate changes from specified commits since the point their histories diverged from the active branch into the active branch</li>
                <ul><li>Running git merge when "non-trivial" changes have been made is discouraged: it can cause merge conflicts that are difficult to resolve</li></ul>

          <li>Squashing commits:</li>
            <ul><li>In some cases, it might be helpful to "squash" the number of commits down to one commit when going to merge your work back into the main branch. To squash commits, take the following steps:</li>
                <ul>          
                  <li>Start an interactive rebase session with git rebase -i HEAD~[number of most recent commits you'd like to squash]</li>
                  <li>The number of commits will show up in the editor preceded by "pick." Replace "pick" with "squash."</li>
                  <li>Enter a message for the new, combining commit, completing the interactive rebase.</li>

      <h2>Vim</h2>
      <div><p>Vim, included as "vi" with most Unix systems and OS X, is an open-source text editor designed for using from the terminal or as a standalone text editor with a GUI. It has 12 different editing modes.</p></div>
      <ul>
        <li>Modes:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Normal: The default mode, used for editor commands; hit Esc to enter Normal mode</li>
            <li>Visual: Used to highlight areas of text to run normal commands on</li>
            <li>Insert: Allows editing/insertion of text; hit i to enter Insert mode</li>
            <li>Command-line / Cmdline: Allows a single line input at the bottom of the Vim window; upon completion of the command, Vim returns to the previous mode</li>
          </ul>
        <li>To navigate lines of text, use the h, j, k, and l keys instead of the mouse or arrow keys</li>
        <li>To navigate between words, use the w, b, and e keys</li>
        <li>You can combine movement keys with a number to move the cursor as instructed multiple times (e.g., 3w is the same as hitting w three times)</li>
