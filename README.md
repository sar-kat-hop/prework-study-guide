# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

    This is a simple website made with two goals; 1) to start to get more familiar and comfortable using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with the basics of programming in preparation for a coding course, and 2) to make a simple resource to collect notes, links, tips and tricks, and other helpful information related to these topics that might be helpful for other students. It also includes some basic console interactivity for fellow coding students to peruse.

    The website currently contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and Vim. 

## Installation

    No installation required.

## Usage

    Review the notes in each section. For a suggestion on what to look at first, open your browser's dev tools (for Chrome, the shortcut is Command+Option+I in MacOS and Control+Shift+I in Windows; you can also right-click and select "Inspect"). A console should open to the bottom or side of the webpage, where each topic is listed with a randomly generated suggestion on which to study first.

## Credits
